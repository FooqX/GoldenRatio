# Golden Ratio

Golden Ratio is a free and open-source (FOSS) Android calculator designed to help you calculate proportional values based on the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio). Whether you're a designer, mathematician, or just curious about the ancient Greek concept of harmonic proportions, this app makes the process easy and intuitive.

## Why?
I made this app for 3 reasons:

1. This was a great way to practice and deepen my understanding of Kotlin and Android development.
2. I couldn't find any Android apps that offered this exact functionality, so I decided to make one.
3. The *Golden Ratio* has been used since ancient times in art, architecture, and design to create aesthetically pleasing proportions. This app simplifies the calculation process for anyone who wants to use it.

- Use [**Droidify**](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client), then search for "Golden Ratio" and install it.
- Add [**IzzyOnDroid**](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/) repository to F-Droid, then search for "Golden Ratio" and install it.
- Download the APK file directly from the releases page.

## Usage
Golden Ratio isn't just a basic A+B calculator; it intelligently fills in missing values based on the *Golden Ratio*. It can compute:
1. **A and B** based on the sum value.
2. **A and Sum** based on the B value.
3. **B and Sum** based on the A value.

### How to use:

- Enter exactly **one** value: `A`, `B`, or `Sum`.
- The app will automatically calculate the missing 2 values using the *Golden Ratio* (and basic math).
- Click "calculate" to calculate, and **click it again to clear the inputs**.
- Click "Clear" to reset only the **history**.

## Features
- No ads, tracking

- Calculate a, b, sum easily using *Golden Ratio*
- Calculated values based on the *Golden Ratio* are marked with the Ï† symbol in history
